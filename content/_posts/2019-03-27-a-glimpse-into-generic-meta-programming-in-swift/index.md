## Preface

What is the most critical thing swings your decision when you choose a
programming language?

Some people may say, the less lines of code they write, the better the
language itself is. (Nope, the best programming language is PHP.)

OK. It might be true. But writing less code is not an essential indicator
that truely leads a programmer to write less code. There is a better way
where to inspect what primitives a programming language has.

There are some old-school programming languages which may not have
multi-dimensional array. This leads an array cannot hold another one in
itself and disallows developers to invent some recursive data structures
and limits the expressiveness of the language. The expressiveness of a
programming language, formally, is the **computational capability of a
programming language**.

But the array example I mentioned above is just about runtime
computational capability. What about the compile-time's?

For languages like C++, they have an explicit compile process and a "code
template" infrastructures to do some compile-time computations by collecting
the pieces of the source code and then organizing them into a piece of new
code. You may have heard a buzz word: "meta-programming". Yes, this just is
meta-programming (but at compile-time) and there is a bunch of programming
languages includes C and Swift can do compile-time meta-programming.

Meta-programming in C++ relies on templates. In Swift, it relies on generics.

Though you can do compile-time meta-programming in these three programming
languages, the capability of them are different. Since there are a lot of
posts on the Internet that talked about the reason why C++ template is
**turing complete** (a measurement of computational capability, you can just
briefly treat it as "be able to compute anything that a normal computer is
able to compute"), I don't want to waste my time on explaining it again
here. What I'm going to talk about is Swift generics which also can do
meta-programming at compile-time but owns a compile-time computability of
**push-down automata**. You can briefly treat is as "is able to compute
things with finite or recursive patterns."

## Case Study : VFL Compile-Time Safety

There are a lot of Auto Layout helper libraries: Cartography, Mansory,
SnapKit... But, are they really good? What if there were a Swift versioned
VFL which ensures the correctness at compile-time and can collaborate with
Xcode's code completion?

Truth be told, I'm a fan of VFL. You can lay many views out by using one
line of code with intuitive symbols. With Cartography or SnapKit, things
always go tedious.

Since the original VFL has some issues with modern iOS design, which
cannot cooperate with layout guides, you may also want layout guide
support in this set of API that we are going to implement.

Finally, in my production code, I built the following API which ensures
compile-time safety and supports layout guide.

```swift
// Make constraints and install to view hierarchy

constrain {
    withVFL(H: view1 - view2)
    
    withVFL(H: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide - view2)
    
    withVFL(H: |-view2)
}

// Just make constraints

let constraints1 = withVFL(V: view1 - view2)

let constraints2 = withVFL(V: view3 - view4, options: .alignAllCenterY)
```

Just imagine that how many lines of code you need for building equivalent
things with Cartography or SnapKit? Cannot wait to know how I build it?
Let's go for it.

### Transforming the Grammar

If we dump the original VFL grammar into Swift source code by trimming the
string literal quotes, then it will soon be found that some characters
used by the original VFL such as `[`, `]`, `@`, `(` and `)` is not allowed
in operator overloading in Swift source code. Thus I transformed the
original VFL grammar into the following grammar:

```swift
// Original VFL: @"|-[view1]-[view2]"
withVFL(H: |-view1 - view2)

// Original VFL: @"[view1(200@20)]"
withVFL(H: view1.where(200 ~ 20))

// Original VFL: @"V:[view1][view2]"
withVFL(V: view1 | view2)

// Original VFL: @"V:|[view1]-[view2]|"
withVFL(V: |view1 - view2|)

// Original VFL: @"V:|[view1]-(>=4@200)-[view2]|"
withVFL(V: |view1 - (>=4 ~ 200) - view2|)
```

### Figuring Out the Implementations

How to achieve this design?

An intuitive answer is to use operator overload.

Yes. I've done this with operator overload in my production code. But how
does the operator overloading work here? I mean, why the operator
overloading is able to convey our design?

Before answering the question above, let's check out some examples.

```swift
withVFL(H: |-view1 - view2 - 4)
```

The code above is an illegal input shall not be accepted. The relative
original VFL is below:

```objectivec
@"|-[view1]-[view2]-4"
```

We can find that there is missing view object or a `-|` after `4`.

The system is expected to be able to handle correct inputs by making the
compiler to accept it and also to handle incorrect inputs by making the
compiler to reject it (because this is what **compile-time safety** means).
The secrete behind this is not some black magic which applied by an mystic
engineer whom has got a very high level title, but simply to make the
compiler accept user inputs by matching user inputs with a defined function
and to reject user inputs by mismatching user input with all defined
functions.

For example, like the `view1 - view2` in a part of the example above, we
can design the following function to handle it:

```swift
func - (lhs: UIView, rhs: UIView) -> BinarySyntax {
    // Do something really combine these two views together.
}
```

If we take the `UIView` and `BinarySyntax` in the code block above as two
states, then we can read the code above as "a `UIView` transitions into
`BinarySyntax` when there is another `UIView` input with overloaded operator
`-`. Such a simple state transition is trivial. But it is the basic building
block of the system.

### NaÃ¯ve State Transitioning

The state transition with types and overloaded operator example I shown
above may give you an intuition: we can build the system by enumerating all
possible state transitions!

But... How many types we are gonna create with this solution?

What you may not know is that: VFL is expressible by a DFA, whose
computability is a subset of push-down automata -- This is critical. Since
we cannot build a system upon an weaker underlying system.

Yes. Since recursive texts like `[`, `]`, `(` and `)` are not really
recursive in VFL (only one level of them can appear in a correct VFL
input and cannot be nested), a DFA is able to express the complete
possible input set of VFL.

Thus I created a DFA to simulate the state transitions of **our design**.
Watch out! I didn't take layout guide into consideration in this figure.
Introducing layout guide may make the DFA much more complicated.

> In the diagram above, `|pre` means prefix `|` operator and respectively
> `|post` means postfix `|` operator, double circle means an accepting
> state and single circle means a receiving state.

Counting the types we are gonna create is a complex task. Since there are
binary operators `|` and `-`, and there are unary operators `|-`, `-|`,
`|prefix` and `|postfix`, the counting method varies over these two kinds
of operators:

A binary operator consumes two input states but an unary operator consumes
one. Each operator creates a new type.

Since even the counting method itself is too complex, I would rather to
explore another approach...

### State Transitioning with Multiple States

I drew the DFA diagram above by deadly putting possible characters to test
whether a state receives them or not, this maps all the things into one
dimension. May be we can create a cleaner expression by abstract the
problem in multiple dimensions.

Firstly, let's write down some simplest syntaxes:

```swift
// Should accept
withVFL(H: view1 - view2)

// Should accept
withVFL(H: view1 | view2)

// Should accept
withVFL(H: |view1|)

// Should accept
withVFL(H: |-view1-|)
```

The syntax tree of them are below:

![Simple Syntaxes](simple-syntaxes.png "Syntax Trees for Simple Syntaxes")

Then we can split the case into two:

- Binary syntaxes like `view1 - view2`, `view1 | view2`.

- Unary syntaxes like `|view1`, `view1-|`.

This makes us to intuitively create two types:

```swift
struct Binary<Lhs, Rhs> { ... }

func - <Lhs, Rhs>(lhs: Lhs, rhs: Rhs) -> Binary { ... }

func | <Lhs, Rhs>(lhs: Lhs, rhs: Rhs) -> Binary { ... }

struct Unary<Operand> { ... }

prefix func | <Operand>(operand: Operand) -> Unary { ... }

postfix func | <Operand>(operand: Operand) -> Unary { ... }

prefix func |- <Operand>(operand: Operand) -> Unary { ... }

postfix func -| <Operand>(operand: Operand) -> Unary { ... }
```

But is this enough?

#### Syntax Attribute

Soon it will be found that we can plug anything on the `Lhs` or `Rhs` of a
`Binary`, or the `Operand` of a `Unary`. To make the compiler really can
reject inccorect user inputs. We have to do some limitations.

Typically, inputs like `|-`, `-|`, `|prefix`, `|postfix` shall only be
appeared the at head and tail side of the syntax. We also want to support
layout guide (such as `safeAreaLayoutGuide`), which also should only be
appeared at the head and tail side of the syntax. Thus we have to constrain
these stuffs to ensured that they are only at the head and tail side of the
syntax.

```swift
|-view-|
|view|
```

Moreover, inputs like `4`, `>=40` shall only be appeared when paired with
preceding and succeeding view/superview or layout guide.

```swift
view - 4 - safeAreaLayoutGuide

view1 - (>=40) - view2
```

The above study of the syntax hinted us to split all things in the syntax
into three groups: **layout'ed object** (views), **confinement** (layout
guides and things wrapped by `|-`, `-|`, `|prefix` and `|postfix`), and
**constant**.

Now we are going to change our design into:

```swift
protocol Operand {
    associatedtype HeadAttribute: SyntaxAttribute
    
    associatedtype TailAttribute: SyntaxAttribute
}

protocol SyntaxAttribute {}

struct SyntaxAttributeLayoutedObject: SyntaxAttribute {}

struct SyntaxAttributeConfinment: SyntaxAttribute {}

struct SyntaxAttributeConstant: SyntaxAttribute {}
```

Then for specific combinations of syntaxes like `view1 - 4 - view2`, we
can make the following syntax types.

```swift
/// connects `view - 4`
struct LayoutableToConstantSpacedSyntax<Lhs: Operand, Rhs: Operand>: 
    Operand where 
    /// Checks the tail part of the lhs syntax is a layouted object
    Lhs.TailAttribute == SyntaxAttributeLayoutedObject,
    /// Checks the head part of the rhs syntax is a constant
    Rhs.HeadAttribute == SyntaxAttributeConstant
{
     typealias HeadAttribute = Lhs.HeadAttribute
     typealias TailAttribute = Lhs.TailAttribute
}

func - <Lhs, Rhs>(lhs: Lhs, rhs: Rhs) -> LayoutableToConstantSpacedSyntax<Lhs, Rhs> { ... }

/// connects `(view - 4) - view2`
struct ConstantToLayoutableSpacedSyntax<Lhs: Operand, Rhs: Operand>:
    Operand where
    /// Checks the head part of the lhs syntax is a constant
    Lhs.TailAttribute == SyntaxAttributeConstant,
    /// Checks the tail part of the rhs syntax is a layouted object
    Rhs.HeadAttribute == SyntaxAttributeLayoutedObject
{
     typealias HeadAttribute = Lhs.HeadAttribute
     typealias TailAttribute = Lhs.TailAttribute 
}

func - <Lhs, Rhs>(lhs: Lhs, rhs: Rhs) -> ConstantToLayoutableSpacedSyntax<Lhs, Rhs> { ... }
```

By conforming to the protocol `Operand`, a type indeed have got two
compile-time storage whose names are `HeadAttribute` and `TailAttribute`,
and values are of type of `SyntaxAttribute`. By calling the
function `-` (anyone in the above code block), the compiler checks if the
left-hand-side and right-hand-side matches any function with the name `-`
by reading generic constraints of the result
type (`ConstantToLayoutableSpacedSyntax` or
`LayoutableToConstantSpacedSyntax`). If it succeeded, we can say that: the
state has successfully transitioned to another.

We can see that, since we've set `HeadAttribute = Lhs.HeadAttribute` and
`TailAttribute = Lhs.TailAttribute` in the body of the types above, the
head and tail attribute of `Lhs` and `Rhs` is transferred from `Lhs` and
`Rhs` to the newly synthesized type now. The value is stored in the type
`HeadAttribute` and `TailAttribute`.

Then we've got our functions which make the compiler to receive input like
`view1 - 4 - view2`, `view1 - 10 - view2 - 19`... Wait! `view1 - 10 - view2 - 19`???
`view1 - 10 - view2 - 19` shall be an illegal input which may be rejected
by the compiler!

#### Syntax Boundaries

Actually, what we did above just have ensured that a view is consecutive
to a number and a number is consecutive is a view, it has nothing to do
with whether the syntax shall be beginning with a view (or layout guide)
and end with a view (or layout guide).

To make a syntax always begins or ends with a view, layout guide or anything
like `|-`, `-|`, `|prefix` and `|postfix`, we have to build a logic to
help our types to **"filter"** those invalid input out, just like what we
did like `Lhs.TailAttribute == SyntaxAttributeLayoutedObject` and
`Rhs.HeadAttribute == SyntaxAttributeConstant` above. We can find that
there are actually two groups of syntax mentioned in this kind of syntax:
**confinement** and **layout'ed object**. To make a syntax always begins
or ends with syntax in this two groups, we have to use compile-time `or`
logic to implemented it. Write it down in runtime code, it is:

```swift
if (lhs.tailAttribute == .isLayoutedObject || lhs.tailAttribute  == .isConfinment) &&
    (rhs.headAttribute == .isLayoutedObject || rhs.headAttribute == .isConfinment)
{ ... }
```

But this logic cannot be simply implemented with Swift compile-time
computation because that the only logic of Swift compile-time computation is
the `and` logic. Since we can only use `and` logic in type constraints in
Swift (by using the `,` symbol between
`Lhs.TailAttribute == SyntaxAttributeLayoutedObject` and
`Rhs.HeadAttribute == SyntaxAttributeConstant` in the example above), we can
only merge
`(lhs.tailAttribute == .isLayoutedObject || lhs.tailAttribute  == .isConfinment)`
and
`(rhs.headAttribute == .isLayoutedObject || rhs.headAttribute == .isConfinment)`
in the above code block into one compile-time storage value then use the
`and` logic to concatenate them.

Then we can change our design into:

```swift
protocol Operand {
    associatedtype HeadAttribute: SyntaxAttribute
    
    associatedtype TailAttribute: SyntaxAttribute
    
    associatedtype HeadBoundary: SyntaxBoundary
    
    associatedtype TailBoundary: SyntaxBoundary
}

protocol SyntaxBoundary {}

struct SyntaxBoundaryIsLayoutedObjectOrConfinment: SyntaxBoundary {}

struct SyntaxBoundaryIsConstant: SyntaxBoundary {}
```

This time, we added two new compile-time storagies: `HeadBoundary` and
`TailBoundary`, and their values are of type of `SyntaxBoundary`. For view
or layout guide objects, they offer head and tail two boundaries of
`SyntaxBoundaryIsLayoutedObjectOrConfinment`. When calling the `-`
function, the a view or layout guide's boundary info transferred to the
newly synthesized type.

```swift
/// connects `view - 4`
struct LayoutableToConstantSpacedSyntax<Lhs: Operand, Rhs: Operand>: 
    Operand where 
    /// Checks the tail part of the lhs syntax is a layouted object
    Lhs.TailAttribute == SyntaxAttributeLayoutedObject,
    /// Checks the head part of the rhs syntax is a constant
    Rhs.HeadAttribute == SyntaxAttributeConstant
{
    typealias HeadBoundary = Lhs.HeadBoundary
    typealias TailBoundary = Rhs.TailBoundary
    typealias HeadAttribute = Lhs.HeadAttribute
    typealias TailAttribute = Lhs.TailAttribute
}

func - <Lhs, Rhs>(lhs: Lhs, rhs: Rhs) -> LayoutableToConstantSpacedSyntax<Lhs, Rhs> { ... }
```

Now, we just have to modify the signature of `withVFL` series functions into:

```swift
func withVFL<O: Operand>(V: O) -> [NSLayoutConstraint] where
    O.HeadBoundary == SyntaxBoundaryIsLayoutedObjectOrConfinment,
    O.TailBoundary == SyntaxBoundaryIsLayoutedObjectOrConfinment
{ ... }
```

Then, only syntaxes whose boundaries are of layout guide or views can be
accept.

#### Syntax Associativity

But the concept of syntax boundaries still cannot help stop the compiler
from accepting inputs like `view1-| | view2` or `view2-| - view2`. This is
because that even the **boundaries** of a syntax is ensured, you cannot
ensure the inner part of the syntax is **associable**.

Thus we introduce the third pair of `associatedtype` in our design:

```swift
protocol Operand {
    associatedtype HeadAttribute: SyntaxAttribute
    
    associatedtype TailAttribute: SyntaxAttribute
    
    associatedtype HeadBoundary: SyntaxBoundary
    
    associatedtype TailBoundary: SyntaxBoundary
    
    associatedtype HeadAssociativity: SyntaxAssociativity
    
    associatedtype TailAssociativity: SyntaxAssociativity
}

protocol SyntaxAssociativity {}

struct SyntaxAssociativityIsOpen: SyntaxAssociativity {}

struct SyntaxAssociativityIsClosed: SyntaxAssociativity {}

```

For syntax like `|-`, `-|` or layout guide in a syntax, we can just
disable their associativity in new type's synthesize progress.

It this enough?

Yes. Actually, I'm cheating here. You may wonder that why I can quickly
spot issues by enumerating some examples and say yes to the question above
without any hesitation. The reason is that I've already enumerated all the
syntax tree constructions on paper. Planning on paper is a good habit for
making things prepared.

Now the core concept of the syntax tree's design is very close to my
production code. You can check it out at [here](https://github.com/WeZZard/CTVFL/tree/master/CTVFL/Syntaxes).

### Generating NSLayoutConstraint Instances

OK. Come back. We still have something to implement, which is
critical to our whole work -- generate layout constraints.

Since the actual thing we get in the argument of `withVFL(V:)` function
series is a syntax tree, we can simply build an environment to evaluate
the syntax tree.

> that "build an environment". But I cannot stop myself from telling you

![Syntax Tree Examples](simple-syntaxes.png "Syntax Tree Examples")

By taking a look into a syntax tree, we can find that each level of the
syntax tree is whether an unary operator node, a binary operator node or
an operand node. We can abstract the computation of `NSLayoutConstraint`
into **small pieces** and ask these three kinds of node to populate the
**small pieces**.

Sounds good. But how to do the abstraction? And how to design those
**small pieces**?

#### Abstracting NSLayoutConstraint's Initialization

Since we are gonna support layout guide, the old fashion API

```swift
convenience init(
    item view1: Any, 
    attribute attr1: NSLayoutConstraint.Attribute, 
    relatedBy relation: NSLayoutConstraint.Relation, 
    toItem view2: Any?, 
    attribute attr2: NSLayoutConstraint.Attribute, 
    multiplier: CGFloat, 
    constant c: CGFloat
)
```

comes to be an unavailable option for us. You cannot get layout guide work
with this API. Yes, I've tried.

Then we may come up with layout anchors.

Yes. This works. My production code makes use of layout anchors. But why
layout anchors work?

In fact, by checking the documentations we can know that the base class
of layout anchors `NSLayoutAnchor` has a group of API that generates
`NSLayoutConstraint` instance. If we can get all the arguments of this
group of API in deterministic steps by evaluating syntax tree generated by
the "language" that we have just designed, then we can abstract a formal
model for this computation progress.

Can we get all the arguments of this group of API in deterministic steps?

The answer is "yes".

#### A Glimpse into Syntax Tree Evaluation

Before handing out the deterministic steps that compute arguments we need,
we have to figure out how Swift syntax tree get evaluated.

In Swift, syntax trees are evaluated with the order of depth-first
traversal. The following figure is the traversal order of syntax
`view1 - bunchOfViews` in code block:

```swift
let bunchOfViews = view2 - view3
view1 | bunchOfViews
```

![Swift Syntax Tree Evaluation](syntax-tree-evaluation.png "Swift Syntax Tree Evaluation")

But even the root node is the first visited node in the whole evaluation
process, since it requires the evaluation result of its left-hand-side
child and right-hand-side child to complete the evaluation, it generates
`NSLayoutConstraint` instance at the last.

#### Abstract NSLayoutConstraint's Computation Procedure

By watching the figure of Swift syntax tree evaluation process above, we
can know that the node `view1` was evaluated at the second but the
evaluation result would be used at the last, thus we need a data structure
to store each node's evaluation result. You probably would come up with
stack. Yes, I'm using stack in my production code. But I have to mention the
reason why we need a stack: with a stack, we are able to transform a
recursive structure into another recursive form or a degenerated form or an
aggragation of values. Since arguments of the API what we've just picked
above can be seen as an aggregation of values, thus stack is what we need.
You may have already guessed that I'm going to use stack, but intuition
doesn't work all the time. We may face problems rationally.

With stack, we have to put all the computational resource that is required
to initialize an `NSLayoutConstraint` instance in a single level.

Moreover, we have to keep the stack to memorize the head and tail node of
the syntax tree that have been evaluated. Thus there should be a room for
the head and tail node for each level of the stack.

Why? Take a look at the following syntax tree:

![A Complicated Syntax Tree](complicated-syntax-tree.png "A Complicated Syntax Tree")

The syntax tree above was generated by the expression below:

```swift
let view2_3 = view2 - view3
let view2_4 = view2_3 - view4
view1 | view2_4
```

When we evaluating the node `-` at the second level of the tree (count
from the root), we have to pick `view3`, which is the "inner" node of the
tree, to make an `NSLayoutConstraint` instance. Actually, generating
`NSLayoutConstraint` instances always needs to pick the "inner" nodes
which with the perspective of the node being evaluated. But for the root
`|` node, the "inner" node soon comes to be `view1` and `view2`. Thus we
have to make the stack to memorize the head and tail node of the syntax
tree that have been evaluated.

#### About the "Return Value"

Yes, we have to design a mechanism to let each node of the syntax tree
to return the evaluation result.

I don't want to talk about how a real computer returns value over stack
frames, because it varies over different size or abstraction patterns (since
generics bring indirection -- which caused by the specialized type is unkown
during the compile-time). In Swift world, because all things are safe, which
means you cannot easily access the same piece of memory with different types
unless by destroying the previous one and initializing another one,
processing data with such a multiple pattern is not a good choice (at least
for coding efficiency).

We just have to use a local variable in the evaluation context to keep
the stack's last pop result (though we also can put it at stack's each
level), then generate instructions to fetch data from that variable. Now
we've done the design of the "return" mechanism.

#### Building the VM

The procedure abstraction that we have done shows a significant
characteristic of stack, thus the "instruction set" can be designed as
to manipulate a stack.

In fact, we just have to let the instructions to do following things:

- Fetch views, layout guides, relations, constants and priorities.

- Generate the information about which anchor to pick.

- Make constraints.

- Pop and push the stack.

The complete production code is [here](https://github.com/WeZZard/CTVFL/blob/master/CTVFL/VM/CTVFLOpcode.swift)

### Assessment

We've done the whole concept of our compile-time-ensured safe VFL.

The question now is what do we gain with it?

#### For Our VFL with Compile-Time Satefy

The advantage we got here is that a guaranteed of correctness of the syntax.
Syntaxes like  `withVFL(H: 4 - view)` or `withVFL(H: view - |- 4 - view)`
would be rejected at compile time.

Then, we've got layout guide worked with our Swift implementation of VFL.

Third, since we're executing instructions which generated by the syntax
trees organized at compile time, the total computation complexity is
`O(N)`, which `N` is the number of instructions a syntax generated. But
since the syntax trees are not constructed as compile-time, we have to
construct the syntax tree at runtime. The good news is that, in my
production code, the syntax tree's type is of `struct`, which means the
whole syntax tree is constructed on stack memory but not heap memory.

In fact, after a whole day of optimizations, the performance of my
production code exceeded all the implementation of existing alternative
solutions (includes Cartography and SnapKit), which of course includes the
original VFL. I would place some optimization tips at the end of this
post.

#### For VFL

Theoretically, the original VFL may have a bit more advantages on
performance over our design -- because the VFL strings can be fetched as C
strings, they are loaded directly and there are no initializations shall be
done before using them. After that, the UI framework of the targeted
platform is ready for parsing the VFL string. Since VFL's grammar is quite
simple, building a parser works with time complexity of `O(N)` is also quite
simple. But I don't know the reason why VFL is the slowest solution which
helps developers to build Auto Layout constraints.

#### Benchmark

The following result is measured by building 10k constraints on iPhone X.

Thank for your reading of this long post. I have to apologize. I lied at
the title. This post is totally not a "glimpse" into Swift generic
meta-programming, it talks about many deep content about computational
theories. But I think this post could give a lot of intuitive example for
these theories.

Finally, may the generics meta-programming in Swift not come to be a part of
contents in iOS engineer interview.
