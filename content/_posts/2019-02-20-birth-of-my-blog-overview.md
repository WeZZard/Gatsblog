As I mentioned in the previous post, there are no blog systems fulfill all my
needs, thus I got started to make my own one. And frankly, this is the first
time that I have such a deep touch with frontend tech stack. 

I just decided to write down the whole process, from design to implementation,
to make a memento of my journey, which conducted by an iOS developer with
industrial design background, into modern frontend tech stack.
